# ðŸš€ Autana Dojo Quick Start

## What You Just Built

You now have a **Sakana Intelligence Layer** that:
- Uses mathematical patterns instead of neural networks
- Runs on CPU only (no GPU needed)
- Achieves 1000x compression vs traditional ML
- Integrates with Claude Avatar taskbar
- Has privilege-based security
- Supports all mathematical fields (not just arithmetic!)

## Test Everything Works

```bash
# Run the test suite
python test_dojo.py
```

## Start the Dojo

```bash
# Start in hybrid mode (default)
python dojo_app.py start

# Start in training mode only
python dojo_app.py start --mode training

# Start in IDE mode only  
python dojo_app.py start --mode ide
```

## Natural Language Commands

Once started, you can use commands like:

```
ðŸ¥‹ Dojo> train a specialist for inventory optimization
ðŸ¥‹ Dojo> find patterns in fibonacci sequence
ðŸ¥‹ Dojo> deploy pricing_specialist
ðŸ¥‹ Dojo> show specialists
ðŸ¥‹ Dojo> switch to IDE mode
```

## Start Avatar Bridge

To connect with Claude Avatar taskbar:

```bash
# In a separate terminal
python dojo_app.py bridge
```

This starts a WebSocket server on port 8765 that the Avatar taskbar can connect to.

## Key Features

### 1. **Privilege System**
- **Training Models**: Sandboxed, can only discover patterns
- **Desktop Models**: Full access to file system and deployment

### 2. **Pattern Engine**
Covers all mathematical fields:
- Arithmetic & Number Theory
- Algebra & Algebraic Structures  
- Geometry & Topology
- Calculus & Analysis
- Discrete Mathematics
- Statistics & Probability
- Information Theory
- Chaos Theory & Dynamics

### 3. **Intelligence Layer**
- Self-spawning specialists
- Pattern-based learning (no data needed!)
- Instant training
- Task queue management

### 4. **Avatar Integration**
- WebSocket communication
- Natural language processing
- Mode transformations
- Real-time updates

## Example Workflow

1. **Create a Specialist**
   ```
   ðŸ¥‹ Dojo> train a specialist for optimizing pricing strategy
   ```

2. **Watch it Train** (instantly!)
   ```
   âœ… Created and training optimization_specialist
   Compression: 1000x smaller than neural networks
   ```

3. **Deploy It**
   ```
   ðŸ¥‹ Dojo> deploy optimization_specialist
   ```

4. **Use from Avatar**
   The specialist is now available to Claude Avatar taskbar!

## No GPUs, No Tensors, Just Math! ðŸ§®âœ¨

Everything runs on simple CPU arithmetic operations using mathematical patterns discovered by Sakana.
