# Autana Dojo - Project Memory

## 🏯 Project Identity

**Name**: Autana Dojo
**Purpose**: Central headquarters for AI discovery systems and self-learning models
**Status**: Initial setup phase
**GitHub**: https://github.com/nickinper/autana-dojo (pending creation)

## 🎯 Core Mission

The Autana Dojo serves as the integration point for:
1. **Sakana Discoveries**: 1,967 mathematical patterns
2. **Claude Avatar System**: Interactive AI interfaces
3. **Self-Training Specialists**: Task-specific model generation
4. **Business Intelligence**: Capitalism and strategy models

## 💡 Key Innovations to Implement

### 1. Discovery Management System
- Central repository for all mathematical discoveries
- Pattern validation and verification
- Discovery impact scoring
- Cross-pattern relationship mapping

### 2. Specialist Training Arena
- Queue analysis system
- Automatic specialist spawning
- Domain-specific compression
- Performance benchmarking

### 3. Model Zoo
- Capitalism specialist (market analysis, patents)
- Strategy specialist (progress tracking, resources)
- Self-learning specialist (profitability, complexity)
- Custom specialist builder

### 4. Integration Framework
- Connect to Claude Avatar System
- Pull from Sakana Discovery engine
- Deploy to production environments
- API for external access

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture Plans

### Database Design
- SQLite for development (simple, file-based)
- PostgreSQL migration path documented
- Pattern storage optimization
- Discovery relationship graphs

### API Structure
- REST endpoints for discovery access
- WebSocket for real-time training
- GraphQL for complex queries
- Authentication and licensing

### Deployment Strategy
- Docker containers for each specialist
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring and analytics
